The act of attempting to forecast the future value of a company’s stock or another
financial instrument traded on an exchange is known as stock market prediction.
A good forecast of a stock’s future price could result in a large profit. A suitable
stock predictions will result in huge profits for both the seller and the broker. It
is often pointed out that prediction is chaotic rather than random, which is true
and means it can be expected by closely examining the stock’s past performance.
For forecasting the future, there have traditionally been two major methods proposed. For predicting the future price of a stock, the technical analysis approach
uses historical stock prices such as closing and opening prices, volume exchanged,
adjacent close values, and so on. The second type of research is qualitative, which
is based on external factors such as company profile, market environment, political, and economic factors. For forecasting stock prices, sophisticated intelligent
techniques based on either technological or fundamental research are now used.
Machine learning is a good way to describe these types of processes. It forecasts a
market value that is similar to the tangible value, improving accuracy. Because of
its effective and precise measurements, the application of machine learning to the
field of stock prediction has piqued the interest of many researchers. The dataset
used in machine learning is crucial. Since even minor changes in the data can result
in massive changes in the outcome, the dataset should be as precise as possible.
